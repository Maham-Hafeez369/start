ls ---->list of files
ls -a---->list of all files(hidden files also) but for power shell it is (ls -Force)
clear command
git --version
cd foldername----->change directory(folder)
git clone link.git------>for cloning repository from github to local
git status------->showing the condition of project
there are 4 types of status that can be shown by status command
1-UNTRCKED
2-MODIFIED
3-STAGED----->ready to be committed(means added but not commited)
4-UNMODIFIED------>unchanged (after commiting or before changing)
git add filename----->add changed or new files to the git staging area(before commiting and after changing stage)
git add .------>add all changes
git commit-m "some message"---------> keep record of changes unlike add
git push  origin main---------->push to github
git push -u origin main---------->push to github and to set stream to origin main (means don't need to write origin main again and again)

Moving to branches:
git branch -------->check branch
git branch -M newname -------------> change branch name
git checkout <branchname> ------------>go to other branch
git checkout -b <branchname> ------------> create new branch
git branch -d <branchname> ---------->delete branch


Merging branches:
git diff branchname----------> give differences between branch we are in and the given branch
git merge branchname-----------> merge two branches
creating pull request----------->on github interface
git pull origin main ------------>pull changes from github to local repository (like merging branches)


Merge conflicts:
these conflicts arise when some changes are made at the same positions in different branches ,then git can't determine which change should be accepted
can be done merge command disscussed above

Undoing changes:
1- after only adding:
git reset <filename>---------> reset that particualr file
git reset -------------->  reset all the files after adding
2- after commiting:
git reset HEAD~1 ------------> undo the latest commit
git reset <hash>------------->  hash is a long number of the commit that we can get using get log command and we will go the that commit whose hash we are using
git log ---------> checking commits
q-----------> quiting
git reset --hard <hash>  ----------> undoing in  vs code as well



Fork: 
--------> to create a copy of a project of your own or of others projets to create pull request for open source contribution
